Closed loop control is used very commonly in FTC, and robotics in general. It is used to have full control over systems on the robot, and make sure they are performing the way the programmer intended. There are a few important concepts to cover when it comes to closed-loop control, including PID, Feedforward, Pure pursuit, etc.
